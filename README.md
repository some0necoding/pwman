## Basic Overview

Passman is a security-focused password manager written in C I made to get in touch with  a bit of
software security and learn more about this topic.  
Its simpler purpose is to store user's accounts along with passwords in encrypted format, in order
to improve user's security in the web. The use of a password manager makes it possible for the user
to adopt a different password for every account he has, so that if one account gets exploited the
others remain safe.
