# password_manager
some password manager written in c just for learning purposes.

IT IS NOT SECURE!

Don't use it to store passwords, it is just a way to both learn c programming language and get in touch with software vulnerabilities.
The code is still incomplete and probably ugly: make me know what's wrong and why plz.
